Implimentation of an exchange

------Notes------

The order book:
- Orders are either bids (buy) or asks (sell).
- The order book is divided into bid side and ask side.
- Each side shows a table of quote-prices and valume at that price aggragates 
over all orders
- Sorted in ascending order with buy side and then ask side
- The difference between best bid and best ask is the bud-ask spread
- The midprice is the mean of the best bid and best ask (often used as current 
market price)
- The mircoproce is a weitghted average price of best bid and ask with respect 
to volume
- A quote that crosses the spread is a bid that is higher than the lowest ask
(hitting the bid, lifting the ask)
- The market tape is a sequential list of timestamped market events

Types of orders:
- Market order: Hits the best available bid or lifts the best ask. If the order
book is smaller than the quantity demanded the rest of the order is ignored.
- Limit order: If the limit orders price crosses teh spread it is executed, if 
not it is ass to the order book.
- Good-for-day Order: Limit orders that expire at the end of trading day
- Fill-or-Kill Order: A merket order than is only execute if it can be 
completely filled at or better than a certain price.
- All-or-Nothing Order: A FOK order that sits on teh exchange for a spesific
duriation and waits for the situation to arrise where there is enough volume
to execute teh transaction and expires after a certain amount of time
- Imeiate-or-Cancel Order: An FOK order that can be partially filled for the 
volume above a certain price
- Iceberg Order: Allows trader to hide the full size of the order. When a 
order is placed in the order book, as its filled it is increased by the 
remainding amount.
- Limit-on-Close Order: If the limit order is at the top of the stack on 
market close then it executes, if not its canceled.
- Market-on-Close: MKT orders that execute on market close.
- Limit-on-Open: Limit order issued at market open
- Market-on-Open: Market order issued at market open
- One-Cancels-Other Order: A pair of two limit orders, if one executes the 
other cancels
- One-Sends_Other Order: A pair of two orders if one is executed the other one
is sent
- Each time an order is placed the exchange returns an order identification 
code. That code can be used to sent a cancel order which removes an order from
the order book. An exit market order cancles all oustaning order.

Fees:
- Various orders can have different fees for accepting, proccessing, and even
canceling orders.
- Historically, fees used to be a charge per unit traded with a bulk discount
so that the percentage falls as the order volume increases.
- In recent years, exchanges have introduced maker-taker fee structure where
'maker' traders who provide liquidity to the market by posting limit orders 
away from the best price are given preferential treatment in the form of 
reduced fees or even payments from the exchange. While 'taker' traders which
remove liquidity from the market by hitting the bid of lifting the ask pay a 
higher fee than the makers.

Algorithmic traders:
- Sales traders are people that execute external client orders and attempt 
to make a magrin on the order by fiding a better deal on the market and keeping
the difference. This also anonymises transactions. This role has been replaced
with algorithms.
- Proprietary traders start with a pot of money and buy and sell assets in the 
market with the intention of turning a profit. They don't work with clients. 
- Some trading algorithms work in machine learning and some in micro-economics
but it has lead to the development of some widely recognised algorithms.
